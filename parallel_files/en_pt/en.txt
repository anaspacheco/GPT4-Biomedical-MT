30043826	to identify factors associated with dysphagia in patients undergoing prolonged orotracheal intubation (pOTI) and the post-extubation consequences. 150 patients undergoing pOTI participated in the study, evaluated according to the deglutition functional level (American Speech Language - Hearing Association National Outcome Measurement System - ASHA NOMS), severity determination (The Simplified Acute Physiology Score - SOFA) and submitted to collection of variables age, mortality, days of orotracheal intubation, number of sessions to introduce oral diet, and days to hospital discharge. We grouped patients according to ASHA classification: 1 (levels 1 and 2), 2 (levels 3, 4 and 5) and 3 (levels 6 and 7). the variables associated with impaired deglutition functionality were age (p<0.001), mortality (p<0.003), OTI days (p=0.001), number of sessions to introduce oral diet (p<0.001) and days to hospital discharge (p=0.018). Multiple comparisons indicated significant difference between ASHA1 and ASHA2 groups in relation to ASHA3 group. ASHA1 and ASHA2 groups had a lower SOFA score when compared with the ASHA3 group (p=0.004). Only 20% of ASHA1 patients and 32% of ASHA2 patients presented safe deglutition levels before discharge. factors associated with dysphagia in patients submitted to pOTI were age over 55 years and orotracheal intubation time (greater in the cases with worse deglutition functionality). The post-extubation consequences were increased mortality and length of hospital stay in the presence of dysphagia.
30043827	To investigate the facilitators and barriers involved in the use of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) by people with complex communication needs in social and therapeutic environments under family members/caregivers and speech-language pathologists (SLP) perceptions. This is a transversal quantitative and qualitative study with 20 family members/caregivers (FCG) and 20 SLP (SLPG). The data was collected by semistructured interviews with specific questionnaires for each group; recorded and transcribed for further analysis. Data was categorized in thematic axes, categories and subcategories, using recurrent and salient criteria. The two most important topics were: barriers and facilitators. Both groups indicate as barriers: high material cost, using other ways to communicate, family member as interpreter, language and cognitive deficits, acceptance of AAC for users and family members, lack of comprehension of AAC and family perceptions of AAC as speech suppress. As facilitators, both groups indicate the use of high technology, versatility and availability of AAC systems, family adherence and engagement, contextualized use of AAC outside of therapeutic contexts and the importance of therapeutic setting and team support. In this way, the main interlocutors in AAC implementation, professionals or family members can be barriers when they make it difficult for users to exercise their autonomy in communication, or facilitators when they encourage and use AAC with users.
30043829	Investigate the performance of native speakers of Brazilian Portuguese in the Test of Narrative Language (TNL) and correlate their performance in its oral narration and narrative comprehension subtests. Participants were 140 individuals with typical language development aged 5-0 to 11-11 (years-months) divided according to age group. Statistically significant difference was observed between the 5-year-old group and all the other age groups and between the 6-year-old group and the 8-, 9-, 10- and 11-year-old groups. The 7-year-old group did not differ from the 6- and 8-year-old groups. Half of the 7-year-old group was in 1st grade of Elementary School and the other half was in 2nd grade, which may have contributed to the non-differentiation between this group and its border-age groups. No statistically significant difference was found between groups as of the age of eight years. Positive correlation was observed between performance in the narrative comprehension and oral narration subtests of the TNL in the 5-, 6- and 7-year-old groups, which did not occur for the other age groups. The Test of Narrative Language differentiated the 5-, 6- and 7-year-old groups, but did not differentiate groups as of the age of eight years. No correlation was found between performance in the oral narration and narrative comprehension subtests of the TNL as of the age of eight years, which suggests mastery of both skills from this age.
30043842	The study aimed to identify information sources for decision-making and barriers to access in the use of scientific journals by Municipal Health Secretaries in the State of Paraná, Brazil. Study participants included Secretaries of Health from 181 municipalities in the year 2014. Interviews focused on the frequency of consultation of resources for obtaining evidence, including from scientific journals. 40.9% of the participants were 18 to 39 years of age (mean age was 43±10.2 years; median 42 years). More than two-thirds (69.1%) had held the office of health secretary for less than five years. The majority were males (56.4%), and only one in three had a graduate degree in public health. The main sources of information were 'non-scientific periodicals' (76.2%), 'print/online journals' (71.4%), and 'Ministry of Health guidelines' (71.3%). The main barriers to use of scientific journals were 'lack of time for reading' (72.9%), 'periodical's high cost' (69.1%), and 'difficulty in identifying the best periodicals' (63.5%). The main information sources were non-scientific periodicals and Ministry of Health guidelines. The use of scientific journals is hindered by lack of time and limited familiarity with scientific language. Access to scientific information should be facilitated by the use of more accessible sources and training for municipal administrators in the use of open-access periodicals. Such measures can foster knowledge of current evidence among municipal health secretaries.
30043844	This article discusses the configuration of specialized healthcare networks and aims to analyze the potential for optimization of geographic access in the chemotherapy network of the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS) in Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, using linear programming. The study used ex post facto mathematical modeling with an analytical objective and a qualitative-quantitative approach, using data collection and literature and document searches as the procedures. The potential for optimization was assessed by the percentage difference between the total distances traveled under the current situation and the optimum solution obtained. The results with the optimized situation included a decrease of 293,246km (14.4%) in the total monthly distance traveled in the network, or a mean reduction of 13.02km per procedure performed, compared to the current distance traveled. This gain would be obtained by redistribution of the municipalities of origin and the referral services' capacity to supply procedures. The results point to great potential for optimization of the target network, proving that linear programming can provide technical support for the configuration of new specialized thematic healthcare networks and optimization of the existing networks.
30043845	The authors analyze the relations between two subareas of Collective Health - Planning and Evaluation - through a bibliometric study of articles, theses, and dissertations published from 1980 to 2016. The overall production on Evaluation exceeds that of Planning, particularly since the 2000s. The capacity to influence health sector administration appears to drive the dispute between the two subareas. Both have theoretical and methodological resources to overcome their reductions under the instrumental logic of so-called managerialism, as well as to consolidate themselves as devices for reflection and change.
30043846	This study aimed to identify the treatment itineraries of Brazilian women with severe maternal morbidity. This was a qualitative, descriptive, exploratory study in a university referral hospital for high-risk pregnancy in the interior of São Paulo State, Brazil. The sample included 16 women with severe complications during pregnancy, childbirth, or postpartum. Data were collected with semi-structured, taped, transcribed interviews subsequently submitted to Content Analysis. The results showed that at the onset of illness, the women take various paths to reach low and high-complexity services, while also relying on neighbor women, pharmacies, and self-medication. They encounter obstacles in the services' receptiveness, continuity of care, case-resolution capacity, and referrals within the healthcare network. Critical points were observed in obstetric care: women are frequently subjected to trekking from one health service to another to obtain care, delays in referrals, and institutional violence. The tertiary hospital was described as receptive and effective. The study identified problems in the entire chain of obstetric care, helping explain how the healthcare system is organized to deal with severe maternal complications.
30043847	The study aimed to investigate inequalities in the commitment of family income to private expenditures on dental care in Brazil. Data were analyzed from 55,970 Brazilian households that participated in the nationwide Family Budgets Survey in 2008-2009. The commitment of family income to private spending on dental care was calculated by dividing the mean annual per capita household spending on dental care by the mean annual per capita income, classified in four categories: > 0%, ≥ 5%, ≥ 10%, and ≥ 20%. Analysis of income commitment only included households with positive spending. Only 2,961 households (7%) reported positive spending on dental care. Mean annual per capita spending was BRL 42.19 (USD 12.78) overall and BRL 602.47 (USD 182.57) among those with positive spending. Households with the highest absolute expenditures on dental care were those from urban areas and the wealthiest quintile. Meanwhile, households with the highest proportional income commitment were from rural areas and the poorest quintile. Among those that reported positive spending, 55% of the households in the poorest quintile committed ≥ 20% of their income to dental care. The proportion was only 6% in the wealthiest quintile of the population. The poorest households in the wealthiest regions of Brazil (Central, South, and Southeast) showed the highest income commitments. There were striking socioeconomic inequalities in spending and income commitment to dental care. The evaluation of these inequalities is relevant for the evaluation and orientation of public health policies.
30043849	Today's intensification of labor is part of the industrial transformations under way in Brazil since the 1990s, involving changes in the social production of auto workers' strain and epidemiological profile. Accident- and disease-related absenteeism is an important indicator of auto workers' strain, with relevance to the health field. The study aims to analyze the intensification of labor and its health implications from the perspective of the health-disease process, based on workers' perceptions at an automobile assembly plant in the ABC Industrial Belt of São Paulo. Workers were asked about the obstacles to returning to work following work-related accidents or diseases (commonly referred to as 'compatible' workers). We conducted six visits to the plant and 20 interviews with assembly line workers. Data were collected from March 2010 to November 2014. The results depict the social figure of the 'compatible' worker, a 'compound fracture' in the production process, expressed as the intensification of labor, characterized by an intense work pace, denser work, extended workdays, and heavy stress, while simultaneously pointing to a trend toward laying off 'compatible' workers. The study contributes to the search for knowledge on the intensification of labor and its health implications. We hope to have produced backing for further research on determination of the health-disease process, based on the incorporation of workers' experience.
30043850	This study aimed to assess the program for use of the monoclonal antibody palivizumab in São Paulo State, Brazil. The evaluation adopted the frame of reference proposed by Donabedian, and the data were discussed on the basis of the guidelines from the Ruling on the use of palivizumab in the national network and in the Manual on Standards and Procedures for Vaccination. Sixteen application services in the state were included, with 693 children/mothers enrolled in the program in 2014 (85.1% of the eligible population). For the structure and process evaluation, scores were created that allowed classifying the application services as adequate, partially adequate, and inadequate (non-compliance rates were ≤ 10%, 11-20%, and > 20%, respectively). Results were evaluated according to the association between failure to administer palivizumab and need for hospitalization due to respiratory disease/symptoms, based on the point and interval odds ratios, with 95% confidence interval and critical p-value < 0.05. Of the 11 application services whose structure was classified as adequate, only two showed adequate process, four showed inadequate process, and five partially adequate process. Risk of ICU admission due to respiratory disease/symptoms increased on average by 30% for each failure (p = 0.003; OR = 1.30; 95%CI: 1.09-1.55). In conclusion, having a favorable structure for the program for use of palivizumab in São Paulo State did not necessarily result in an adequate process. In general, the situation with the structure was better than the process. All doses of the monoclonal antibody need to be administered in order to prevent hospitalization from respiratory disease/symptoms.
30043853	Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been considered a promising strategy for controlling the global HIV epidemic. However, it is necessary to translate the knowledge accumulated from clinical trials and demosntration studies to the reality of health services and the groups most vulnerable to infection in order to achieve broad coverage with PrEP. The article proposes a reflection on this challenge, focusing on three dimensions: users of prophylaxis, with an emphasis on the contexts of sexual practices and the potential exposures to HIV; the advantages of prophylaxis as compared to other methods and the challenges for protective and safe use; and health services, considering the organizational principles to ensure greater success in the supply and incorporation of PrEP as part of combination prevention strategies. The following principles were analyzed: uniqueness of care, freedom of choice and non-hierarchization of prevention methods, sexual risk management, scheduling flexibility, and complementary and multidisciplinary care. These principles can foster organization of the health service and care, facilitating linkage and retention in care. Some comments were offered on the relative incompatibility between the existing structure of services and the Brazilian Ministry of Health guidelines for offering PrEP. The conclusion was that the success of PrEP as a public health policy depends on two essential factors: ensuring that health services are culturally diverse settings, free of discrimination, and the intensification of community-based interventions, including social networks, in order to reduce inequalities in access to PrEP and health services as a whole.
30043898	Prepare an instrument to evaluate reading comprehension and verify the influence of receptive vocabulary on the reading comprehension of 3rd to 5th-grade Elementary School students with typical development. All ethical precepts were accomplished. Study participants were 69 3rd-, 4th- and 5th-grade students (35 girls) with mean ages of 8.2, 9.2, and 10 years, respectively, with typical development in the School Performance Test. Half of the sample underwent the reading comprehension test using the question-and-answer method and the other half took the test using the Cloze technique. All students completed the Teste de Vocabulário por Figuras USP (TVFUSP) with 139 stimuli. The schoolchildren presented good performance in receptive vocabulary despite their low socioeconomic level. Better performance was observed in explicit questions compared with that in implicit questions. Students demonstrated more homogeneous and similar performance between the school years in the Cloze technique. No conclusive results were found regarding the correlation between receptive vocabulary and reading comprehension by the two methods. There is evidence of the influence of receptive vocabulary on the reading comprehension of texts, mainly in the question-and-answer method. The prepared instrument, including both assessment methods of reading comprehension, is efficient to investigate and characterize the reading comprehension of 3rd to 5th-grade Elementary School students, and both methods significantly differentiated students in the 3rd and 5th grades.
30043899	To investigate the auditory perception of lay judges of the voice gender identification of women with Reinke's edema and to associate it with its severity and fundamental frequency (F0). This is an observational, analytical and cross-sectional study. A total of 46 lay judges analyzed 48 samples (counting numbers 1 to 10) of 24 women with Reinke's edema - the Reinke's Edema Group (REG) and 24 individuals, men and women, with other types of voice disorders - Control Group (CG). The judges had to classify the voices as being of a man or a woman. Additionally, they needed to indicate their certainty or not about their choice. Results were associated with the severity of the Reinke's edema (Type 1, 2 or 3) and the F0 (extracted from the vowel /Ɛ/). Misidentification of gender was higher in the REG and certainty about the choice was higher in the CG. Type 1 cases caused fewer misidentifications compared to type 2 and 3. The women's voices that were identified as male voices had a lower F0 (141Hz) when compared to voices that were correctly identified (149Hz). Women with Reinke's edema are frequently identified as men. Lower F0 was related with more misidentification and less certainty when assessing the speaker's gender.
30043900	to report a series of cases of robotic bariatric surgery in the treatment of obesity in Brazil. we evaluated patients undergoing robotic bariatric surgery at the Garrido Institute and compared them with a group submitted to conventional laparoscopic surgery. we analyzed 45 patients, with a mean age of 39.44 years, of which 34 were female, with an initial mean BMI of 41.26kg/m2. Among the procedures performed, 91.11% were Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, while 8.89% were sleeve gastrectomy. The mean total surgery time was 158 (±56.54) minutes, with mean docking time of 7.93 (±3.9) minutes, and console time 113.0 (±41.4) minutes. The average pain presented in the post anesthetic recovery was 2.61 (±3.30) points on a scale of 0 to 10; four patients presented with mild signs of nausea, responding well to drug treatment. Only one patient needed ICU admission for a period of two days after surgery due to previous cardiopathy. In two cases, there was an incisional hernia at the trocar site, which were surgically treated without further complications. In the comparison between robotic versus laparoscopic surgery groups, 45 patients were selected for each group. Operative time was significantly longer in the robotic surgery group, with most other variables being equivalent, including postoperative control of comorbidities. robotic bariatric surgery is a safe procedure, with results comparable to laparoscopic surgery.
30043901	to assess the physicians' knowledge regarding intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome and to compare it with the established literature. we conducted a descriptive, observational, cross-sectional, quantitative study. We interviewed 38 physicians through a self-administered questionnaire composed of objective questions. We carried out the study in a tertiary reference university hospital, located in Curitiba, Paraná. the mean age of the participants was 28 years, 60.5% were female and the mean time of medical experience was 3.5 years. Regarding the knowledge on the subject, 57.9% considered that abdominal compartment syndrome starts with intra-abdominal grade III hypertension, 50% considered abdominal perfusion pressure the most reliable method to determine intra-abdominal hypertension, 89.4% considered the intravesical measuring technique as the most used, 71.1% considered oliguria to be the early sign of abdominal compartment syndrome. Of the interviewees, 81.6% did not measure intra-abdominal pressure because there was no protocol defined by the service. Seventy-nine percent of respondents said they did not know the definitions of the consensus of the World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (WSACS). half of the physicians were able to classify intra-abdominal hypertension and indicate the onset of abdominal compartment syndrome correctly.
30043928	To assess the effectiveness of telephone educational interventions on the duration and exclusiveness of breastfeeding. A systematic review of the literature was conducted including only Randomized Clinical Trials. The exposure factor was an educational intervention via telephone, and the outcomes were duration and exclusiveness of breastfeeding. Literature in Portuguese, English and Spanish published between 2010 and 2016 were searched for in the Cochrane, Lilacs, Medline and Scopus databases. The articles were analyzed through a results synthesis. 241 articles were identified, of which 231 did not meet the inclusion criteria. Therefore, only 10 articles were reviewed. Four studies showed no efficacy related to breastfeeding. Regarding common characteristics, these studies were performed in short periods and in pairs. The others revealed efficacy regarding duration and/or exclusiveness of breastfeeding. The latter were mostly studies with long-term interventions and carried out by nurse lactation consultants. The evidence demonstrates that the telephone is a viable technology for promoting breastfeeding, representing an alternative for the health units and health professionals that can contribute to mother-baby care.
30043929	To describe the construction process of an intervention in the form of a Nursing Care program to Adolescents aimed at preventing and controlling overweight/obesity in the school environment. A methodological study developed through Intervention Mapping in Natal/RN, Brazil, between October of 2015 and September of 2016, with the participation of adolescents, public school teachers and nurses in Primary Health Care. Data sources were focus groups, interviews and an integrative review. The Collective Subject Discourse was used for analysis. At the end of the six stages of the Intervention Mapping, the 'School Health Nursing Program' (Programa de Enfermagem Saúde na Escola) was constructed, which should be implemented over 10 months with five weekly classes of exercises and a weekly session of nursing interventions detailed in the Program. The nursing intervention guided by Intervention Mapping allows actions based on theories, community participation, school/service bonds, and care continuity.
30043930	To describe and interpret the experience of breastfeeding among women who underwent mammoplasty surgery prior to motherhood. A descriptive, qualitative study developed with women attended at a Human Milk Bank between 2014 and 2015. Data analysis was based on the content analysis method and supported by the Interactive Theory of Breastfeeding. 13 women participated in the study. Four categories emerged: 1) Success (or lack thereof) in Exclusive Breastfeeding: influence of maternal and child biological conditions; 2) Maternal feelings: perception about breastfeeding; 3) Decision making on the continuity of breastfeeding or the use of formula; 4) The role of health professionals in protecting, promoting and supporting breastfeeding: Information (or lack thereof) on the implications of the surgery. Unfavorable biological conditions of the women who underwent mammoplasty generated unsuccessful experiences in exclusive breastfeeding and limited their decision-making, despite their desire to breastfeed.
30043931	The 'Brave New World' envisioned a society dominated by scientific and technological progress that went as far as to subjugate and dehumanize human beings. The future foreseen in this literary work is not far from what we are currently experiencing. Thus, considering that Nursing is affected and challenged in the midst of these technological transformations, this article aims to discuss the present and future of Nursing in a society that is undergoing constant technological transformations. In the midst of a whole technological apparatus in which fundamental procedures begin to be carried out by machines, Nursing needs to begin reflecting on what would be the best posture or its differential in a world with strong technological tendencies. Future transformations are still uncertain, nonetheless they will drastically change the way individuals relate to one another and to health services. Even in the midst of these uncertainties arising from present and future technological and scientific advances, the nature of Nursing which is essentially based on human interactions, can guarantee a place of prominence for this profession in society.
30043941	To analyze the association between the occurrence of pruritus and adherence to the prescribed diet, biochemical indicators of renal function and the quality of hemodialysis in chronic renal patients. A cross-sectional study performed at a dialysis clinic in the Northeast of Brazil, with 200 patients undergoing hemodialysis in the first half of 2015.To analyze the data, inferential statistics were used, using Chi-Square and Fisher's Exact tests; and Mann Whitney U test. The pruritus was present in 51% of the sample, being associated statistically with phosphorus consumption (P = 0.024) and elevation of serum calcium (P = 0.009). Pruritus in chronic renal patients undergoing hemodialysis is influenced by adequate nonadherence to the prescribed diet, in addition to the elevation of biochemical indicators of renal function.
30043942	To describe the epidemiological characteristics of perinatal deaths through the actions of the Unified Health System. This is a descriptive study of temporal analysis with a population of perinatal deaths of mothers residing in Recife, Brazil, from 2010 to 2014. A list was used to classify the preventable diseases and the variables were analysed using Epi lnfo™ version 7. The perinatal deaths totalled 1,756 (1,019 foetal and 737 neonatal premature) with a reduction of neonatal deaths (-15.8%) and an increase of foetal deaths (12.1%) in the study period. The main causes of death were foetus and newborn affected by the mother´s condition and asphyxia/hypoxia at birth. Most deaths were avoidable, especially in the group of appropriate care to mothers during pregnancy. Faults in the care provided to women at birth explain the percentage of deaths caused by asphyxia/hypoxia. The reduction of preventable perinatal mortality is associated with the increased access and quality of care, which ensures health promotion, disease prevention, treatment and specific and timely care.
30043943	To identify theoretical frameworks and instruments for the evaluation of critical thinking to base studies in nursing and education. Integrative review, with a selection of scientific articles in Portuguese, English and Spanish, in the LILACS, SCIELO, IBECS, MEDLINE/PubMed and SCOPUS databases, using the descriptors 'thought', 'teaching' and 'nursing' in Portuguese and English. The search resulted in 3,147 articles, and 23 papers published between 2010 and 2015 were selected. Fourteen (60.2%) studies used the Facione framework and eight (34.4%) resorted to different critical thinking assessment tools applied in nursing and education. Most studies used the Facione framework. Among the evaluation tools, the California Critical Thinking Skills Test (CCTST) and the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal stood out as the most common instruments; both focus on cognitive skills in critical thinking.
30043944	To identify scientific literature on oncology nurses who provide patient navigation services as nurse navigators. Integrative review of literature searches in the databases LILACS, MEDLINE/PubMed, SCOPUS, SciELO, Web of Science and Science Direct based on the descriptors patient; navigation; nurse; professional; cancer; oncology; navigator; and navigators. Seventeen articles were identified and grouped according to the following thematic approach: Care Processes; Patients; and Health Workers. It was observed that scientific literature on nurse navigators mostly comes from the United States, Australia, Canada, Sweden, and Demark, where the first nurse navigator programmes were introduced. No studies were found in local journals or populations. The nurse navigator offer a unique service for the provision of quality care. Although international research is recent, further studies on the role of these professionals are clearly needed.
30043945	To verify the adequacy of the roles and functions performed by higher education professionals in the services of psychosocial care network in a Northeastern Brazilian capital. Cross-sectional, analytical study of quantitative approach. The sample was composed of 65 professionals from seven services of psychosocial care network in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. A questionnaire with closed and semi-open questions was used. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 20.0, with the chi-square test and the Fisher's exact test application. A significance level of 5 % (p<0,05) was adopted. Inadequacy regarding the care of family groups (52.3%), specialist training in mental health (69.2%, p=0.02), and working difficulties in services (87.7%) were detected. The roles and functions carried out by professionals in the services surveyed are adequate, although coexisting with numerous difficulties.
30043946	To analyze the conceptions of the nursing professionals working in Basic Health Units regarding the detection and prevention of violence against the elderly. Descriptive, exploratory, qualitative study. Performed in two BHUs in Mossoró/RN, using a semi-structured interview script, from March to August of 2013. Sample composed of four nurses and six nursing technicians. The content analysis, pre-analysis, material exploration, and treatment of results were performed. Four categories were identified: Strategies used to identify violence against the elderly; Types of violence against the elderly; Conduct used after finding a suspicion of violence; SUS and the problem of violence against the elderly. Many professionals recognize/distrust possible cases, however, they do not know how to proceed. The dimension of the problem requires that pragmatic interventions be performed in the clinical setting and in the social context. There is a need for continuing education for professionals and greater communication between the bodies responsible for reporting and embracement.
30043947	To analyse the structure and contents of the social representations of nurses concerning domestic violence against women. This is a qualitative study conducted with 100 nurses between May and September 2014 in two hospitals of Rio Grande, RS, Brazil. Data were collected through evocations and semi-structured interviews. The data were processed in Evoc software and subjected to contextual analysis, respectively. A negative representation was identified with core elements alluding to forms of violence and its judgment, expressed as 'physical aggression' and 'contempt'. In the periphery, 'fear' is how the professionals and the victims feel toward the aggressor and 'submission' is mentioned as a cause of violence. The term 'verbal aggression' in the contrast zone suggests the possibility of a subgroup with a different representation. A centralised view regarding physical injuries and the culpabilisation of domestic abuse victims can limit care actions, revealing the need to discuss this subject with health workers.
30043948	To analyze the understanding of municipal managers of health about public policies destined to the elderly population and the way they are effected in the city. Qualitative study, developed with 14 municipal managers of health. Data were collected through a semi-structured interview and analyzed according the precepts of content analysis. The results show the lack of knowledge of the municipal health managers, related to public policies of attention to the elderly. Also, the attention given to the elderly in the studied municipalities focuses on measures to control health problems. The municipalities do not have specific health care policies for the elderly population. Thus, these results can support reflections about care for the elderly in health services, their relationship with legislation, and the applicability of public health policies.
30043949	To identify and compare the structure and content of representations of domestic violence against women among students in the initial and final grades of a nursing undergraduate course. A qualitative study was carried out between August/November 2014, in Rio Grande/RS, with 132 nursing students, 71 of the initial grades and 61 of the final grades. The data has been collected through evocations and interviews; for the treatment, the EVOC software and content analysis have been used. Approval under Opinion 109/2014. In common in the central nucleus are the terms violence, cowardice, disrespect and pain. The first group evoked sadness and the second, physical violence. The representation has negative connotations, with discrete differentiation. The students of the final series are based on the reified knowledge and have the structured representation, with concept, image and attitude. It is hoped that the students will contribute to the prevention, identification and intervention of victims of violence.
30043950	To build qualitative outcome indicators in psychosocial care regarding autonomy from the perspective of users and their families. This is an evaluative case study based on the dialectical hermeneutics theoretical framework, conducted at a mental health community service, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The first stage of data collection occurred between February and July 2014, and consisted of constructing indicators based on qualitative data analysis of the two evaluative studies conducted at this same service. The second stage, between August and September 2014, consisted of validating the indicators constructed through the focus groups with nine users and nine family members. The users and relatives stated three qualitative indicators related to their autonomy resulting from their insertion in the service. The indicators were better self-management of income, improved everyday activities, and greater bargaining power. The methodology proved appropriate to create qualitative indicators, from the perspective of the participants, and revealed that the service helps users achieve autonomy.
30043951	To evaluate the occupational stress among health workers in a university hospital. Cross-sectional study conducted with health workers in the areas of nursing and medicine at a university hospital in southern Brazil. The data were collected between August of 2011 and August of 2012 by a questionnaire of characterization and Job Stress Scale. A descriptive and univariate analysis was performed (Kruskal-Wallis). The participants presented high demand and high control of the work and low social support, indicating an active work. Nurses had less control over work (p<0.001) and physicians received more social support (p=0.006). Reduced social support was related to greater exposure to stress among nursing assistants and technicians (p=0.012). Workers who felt the low social support had higher exposure to stress. It is necessary to implement stress prevention strategies among health workers, such as the strengthening of social support at work.
30043952	To develop a conceptual framework that explains how elderly people from different cultures experience aging, formulate concepts and assign values to the process of aging. Qualitative research conducted with 33 elderly people in a municipality of the triple border. The data were collected between February and August of 2011, using Symbolic Interactionism and the Grounded Theory as the theoretical and methodological strategy. The central theme identified was: 'Having to age: sociocultural practices guiding aging in different ethnicities', which was made up of sub processes that characterize the study's structural concepts: aging conceived as multifactorial (physical, biopsychic and sociocultural); Experiencing aging in the process of cultural adaptation; Experiencing aging as the continuation of life; Redefining social roles; and The culture influencing habits and customs in healthcare. The experience of aging proved to be a unique process for each individual and the values assigned to it are influenced by one's own culture.
30056460	The aim of this study was to assess history of orthodontic treatment and its determinants in adolescents. This was a crosssectional study conducted in the city of Passo Fundo, Brazil, on a representative sample of adolescents aged 15 to 19 years, regularly enrolled in 20 high schools. A structured questionnaire was applied to assess demographic, behavioral and health variables. The association between history of orthodontic treatment and the dependent variables was analyzed by the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Additionally, multivariate regression with robust variance was performed. A total 736 students were examined and interviewed, of whom 57. 6% had undergone orthodontic treatment, while 42. 4% had not. In the multivariable analysis, the following variables were significantly associated with history of orthodontic treatment: female (PR= 1. 26; 95% CI: 1. 11-1. 43), white (PR= 1. 32; 95% CI: 1. 11-1. 56), mothers with higher level of education (PR=1. 49; 95% CI: 1. 28 -1. 74), tooth loss (PR=1. 21; 95% CI: 1. 06-1. 39), and concern about oral health (PR=0. 69; 95% CI: 0. 61-0. 78). Attending a private school was not significantly associated with history of orthodontic treatment (p>0. 05). This study found a high rate for history of orthodontic treatment among adolescents, associated with gender, ethnicity, adolescent's mother with higher education, and tooth loss. Concern about oral health was a protective factor for orthodontic treatment.
30056461	The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of 2. 5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), 17% ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), and 1% peracetic acid (PAA) on human fibroblasts. FG11 and FG15 cell lines were cultured in 24-well cell culture plates for cell proliferation assessment and 96-well cell culture plates for the methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay; Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was used as control data. The experimental solutions were used at 0. 01%, 0. 05%, and 0. 1% dilutions and assessed at 1-, 2-, and 4-hour intervals. Data were subjected to statistical analysis by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by the Bonferroni test at a significance level of p <0. 05. The assessment of cell proliferation in this study showed cytotoxicity to the fibroblasts with 2. 5% NaOCl for all three dilutions at all time intervals, 17% EDTA for the 0. 05% and 0. 1% dilutions at the 2- and 4-hour intervals, and 1% PAA for all three dilutions at the 4-hour interval. The cell viability assay (MTT assay) for fibroblasts showed 2. 5% NaOCl to be cytotoxic at the 0. 05% and 0. 1% dilutions at all time intervals, 17% EDTA to be cytotoxic at the 0. 1% dilution at the 2- and 4-hour intervals, and 1% PAA to be cytotoxic at the 0. 1% dilution at the 2- and 4-hour intervals. In conclusion, 1% PAA was less cytotoxic than 2. 5% NaOCl and 17% EDTA.
30056462	The aim of the present study was to identify the relationship among instruments used to screen and diagnose temporomandibular disorders (TMD). A retrospective study was conducted using medical records of patients with temporomandibular disorder who had visited the institution for initial assessment between January and December 2015. Medical history and physical examination data were collected, particularly those focusing on the diagnosis of TMD and TMJ (temporomandibular joint) function. The following instruments were used to assess the severity of the TMD signs and symptoms: the Fonseca Anamnestic index (FAI), the Helkimo index (HI), the American Association of Orofacial Pain Questionnaire (AAOPQ) and the Jaw Symptom & Oral Habit Questionnaire (JSOHQ). Thirty-eight patient records were included, with prevalence of women (84. 6%) and mean age 37. 42 ± 14. 32 years. The patients who were classified as having severe TMD by the FAI exhibited more positive responses on the AAOPQ (6. 25 ±1. 42; one-way ANOVA F= 15. 82), with a statistically significant difference when compared to patients with mild TMD (3. 0 ±1. 22; p<0. 01). A positive correlation (r=0. 78; p<0. 01) was found between the number of positive responses on the AAOPQ and the sum of the JSOHQ scores. Patients who were classified with severe TMD on the FAI exhibited higher scores on the JSOHO (18. 58 ±4. 96/oneway ANOVA F=14. 43), with a statistically significant difference when compared to patients with moderate (12. 08 ±5. 64; p<0. 01) and mild TMD (7. 46 ±4. 89; p<0. 01). In the study sample, there was consistency among the instruments used to differentiate patients with severe and mild TMD. The selection of instruments should be rational, in order to improve the quality of the results.
30064145	To assess the relationship between the use of psychoactive substances during pregnancy and the occurrence of severe maternal morbidity (SMM), perinatal outcomes and repercussions on the neuropsychomotor development of exposed children.  A case-control study nested within a cohort of severe maternal morbidity (COMMAG) was performed. Women with SMM were considered cases. Controls were those with low-risk pregnancy, without SMM and admitted during the same time period as the cases. Cohort data were collected retrospectively in hospital records for childbirth. A face-to-face interview was also performed with 638 women (323 without SMM and 315 with SMM) and their children of the index pregnancy between 6 months and 5 years after childbirth. During the interview, substance abuse during pregnancy was assessed by a modified question from the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test 2.0 (ASSIST) and the neuropsychomotor development in the children was assessed by the Denver Developmental Screening Test, 2<sup>nd</sup> edition.  The prevalence of licit or illicit drug use during pregnancy was ∼ 17%. Among drug users, 63.9% used alcohol, 58.3% used tobacco, 9.2% used cocaine/crack and 4.6% used marijuana. There was no association between drug use during pregnancy and SMM, although tobacco use during pregnancy was associated with bleeding, presence of near-miss clinical criteria (NMCC) and alteration in infant development; alcohol use was associated with neonatal asphyxia; and cocaine/crack use was associated with the occurrence of some clinical complications during pregnancy.  The use of psychoactive substances during pregnancy is frequent and associated with worse maternal, perinatal and child development outcomes.
30066724	Evaluate high-frequency auditory thresholds, seeking to compare responses between the ears, to verify the correlation between hearing level and aging and analyze frequency responses in normal hearing adults. This is a prospective, quantitative, transversal study conducted with a convenience sample. Study participants were 60 individuals aged 18 to 58 years (mean=25.82) with auditory thresholds within normality standards (250-8000 Hz) and normal results in acoustic immittance measurements. High-frequency pure-tone hearing thresholds were determined using an Interacoustics AS10HF audiometer with electrodynamic high-fidelity KOSS R/80 headphones, with thresholds expressed in dBNPS. Hearing thresholds showed an increase for the right ear with statistical significance at the 10, 11 and 14 kHz frequencies and a tendency to significance at 13 kHz. As of the 14 kHz frequency, a progressive increase directly proportional to the frequency was observed bilaterally, with the thresholds increasing proportionally to age advancement for all frequencies. High-frequency auditory thresholds progressively increase proportionally to frequency and age advancement in normal hearing individuals, with higher values ​​for the right ear.
30066731	ANDROMEDA-SHOCK is an international, multicenter, randomized controlled trial comparing peripheral perfusion-targeted resuscitation to lactate-targeted resuscitation in patients with septic shock in order to test the hypothesis that resuscitation targeting peripheral perfusion will be associated with lower morbidity and mortality. To report the statistical analysis plan for the ANDROMEDA-SHOCK trial. We describe the trial design, primary and secondary objectives, patients, methods of randomization, interventions, outcomes, and sample size. We describe our planned statistical analysis for the primary, secondary and tertiary outcomes. We also describe the subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Finally, we provide details for presenting our results, including mock tables showing baseline characteristics, the evolution of hemodynamic and perfusion variables, and the effects of treatments on outcomes. According to the best trial practice, we report our statistical analysis plan and data management plan prior to locking the database and initiating the analyses. We anticipate that this procedure will prevent analysis bias and enhance the utility of the reported results.
30066736	to create a multidisciplinary conducts manual for tracheostomies in adult and pediatric patients in the Amazonas State Oncology Control Center Foundation. we developed a protocol using the modified Delphi method, which consisted in the application of two series of questionnaires to 20 professionals of the unit. thirteen professionals completed the two steps. In the first stage, there was consensus in 53 out of 92 questions (57.6%). The questions that obtained consensus formed the text of the second stage, divided into eight chapters and evaluated by marking the answers offered on a Linkert scale. All the chapters presented in the second stage obtained consensus, meaning that the sum of the answers 'agree' and 'fully agree' were above 70%. using the data obtained in the consensus, we elaborated a tracheostomy conduct protocol and a care guidelines manual for the patients and their caregivers.
30066737	to study the efficacy and safety of the use of subconjunctival triamcinolone acetate alone or in combination with mitomycin C as a modulator of trabeculectomy healing in rabbits. we submitted thirty male, albino, New Zealand rabbits to bilateral trabeculectomy. We divided the animals into four experimental groups with 15 eyes per group: control, mitomycin C, triamcinolone acetate and triamcinolone acetate + mitomycin C. We performed aplanation tonometry and clinical analysis of the bleb through the Moorfields Graduation System in the postoperative period. For the evaluation of healing, we carried out the quantitative analysis of the inflammatory infiltrate (polymorphonuclear) through Hematoxylin & Eosin staining, and vascular proliferation, through immunohistochemistry. we observed a significant decrease in postoperative intraocular pressure in all groups compared with the preoperative pressure (p<0.001). However, there was no difference between groups (p=0.186). The triamcinolone + mitomycin C acetate group presented better indices as for the maximum bleb height and vascularization of the bleb central area (p=0.001); in addition, there was a lower inflammatory response (p=0.001) and lower vascular proliferation (p=0.001) in the intermediate phase of the study compared with the monotherapies. the combination of mitomycin C and triamcinolone acetate resulted in a synergistic action between these agents, with broader and more diffuse blebs, less inflammatory infiltrate and less vascular proliferation in the intermediate stages of follow-up in this animal model.
30066738	Inappropriate therapy of postoperative pain in laparoscopic cholecystectomy may lead to late mobilization, patient dissatisfaction, delayed hospital discharge, and chronic pain development. Our objective was to identify the best therapeutic strategy available to the anesthesiologist for the acute postoperative pain of patients submitted to elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This is a systematic review that included 36 complete articles indexed in the Medline, Scopus, Web of Science and LILACS databases, with a five-year time cut (2012 to 2016), resulting from controlled and randomized studies that were submitted to qualitative analysis. In a proposal for multimodal analgesia, it is important to consider the contraindications, adverse effects, dose and optimal timing of interventions. Non-opioid drugs, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)/cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, gabapentin/pregabalin, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, and others. Opioids may be used at low doses associated with multimodal therapy or are restricted to cases where non-opioid multimodal analgesia is insufficient. We conclude that there is no consensus as to the best analgesic strategy to be implemented in the acute postoperative pain of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which requires its applicability in an individualized way, based on the scientific evidence found in the literature. As contribution to medical learning and practice, we point out the theoretical enrichment of the analgesic drug options available for the therapy of postoperative pain in patients submitted to elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and alert the team to consider the adverse effects of the interventions implemented.
30066818	To describe a case of congenital syphilis with a late diagnosis and identify missed opportunities at diverse phases/levels of healthcare, which led to late diagnosis. Boy, 34 days of life, referred from a basic healthcare unit to a tertiary hospital due to enlarged abdominal volume and progressive jaundice for 2 weeks, fecal hypocholia, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, low platelet count and elevated liver enzymes. At physical examination, the infant presented with erythematous-exfoliative lesions on the palms and soles, macular rash in the inguinal region, ascitis, palpable liver 5 cm below the right costal margin and a palpable spleen 3 cm from the left costal margin. Infant serology: reactive CMIA (chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay), VDRL (Venereal Diseases Research Laboratory) 1:1024 and reactive TPHA (Treponema pallidum Hemagglutination). Maternal serology: reactive CMIA and TPHA, VDRL 1:256. Radiography of the long bones showed symmetric periostitis, periosteal thickening, and lucent bands in the femur, humerus, ulna and tibia. After treatment with crystalline penicillin, the infant showed clinical and laboratory improvement, receiving hospital discharge at the 18th hospitalization day. This case shows that congenital syphilis is occasionally diagnosed late as a result of failed strategies to prevent this disease, both in the basic and secondary/tertiary levels of care. The application of interventions recommended by the Ministry of Health and identification of the situation in which there is ineffective implementation of these measures are important to assess routine care in all levels of healthcare and diverse units responsible for newborn and infant health care.
30066819	To verify the relationship between polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor gene (VDR), clinical findings, and serum vitamin D (VD) levels in asthmatics. A cross sectional study of 77 children aged 7 to 14 years old, who were attended at a specialized clinic. The children were divided into 3 groups: asthmatics who had been using inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for more than one year; asthmatics who had not been using ICS; non-asthmatics, and children without allergies (according to the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood -- ISAAC). Spirometry, skin prick tests, the presence of a VDR promoter CDX2 polymorphism from an allele-specific polimerase chain reaction (PCR), exons 2 and 3 polymorphisms genotyping by PCR-SSCA (single-strand conformational analysis), total immunoglobulin E (IgE) and specific IgE to mites and grass were evaluated in these three groups. Levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were determined in asthmatics only. The mean age of the children was 10.8±2.0 years old, 57% were male, 38 were asthmatic and using ICS, 22 were asthmatic and not using ICS, and 17 were non-asthmatic. Allergic rhinitis was present in 90% of asthmatics. Homozygous CDX2 was detected in 23% of the patients and absent in the control group (p=0.03). Lower forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1%) values were observed in CDX2 homozygous asthmatics (p=0.001). Variations in the exon 2 and 3 sequences were not related to asthma or the other tests. VD deficiency or insufficiency was detected in 98% of asthmatics. There was no association between VD levels and genetic polymorphisms from exons 2 and 3. There was a positive association between homozygous CDX2 polymorphism, asthma and lower FEV1% values. CDX2 is capable of modifying cell interaction between VDR and VD, and it could be associated with the prevalence of asthma, and the difficulty in controlling the disease.
30066820	To examine the profile and appropriate use of antibiotics among hospitalized children. A cross-sectional study was conducted with children who had taken antibiotics during hospitalization in a private philanthropic hospital in Southern Brazil, from January to December 2015. The data were obtained by reviewing medical records, encompassing demographic data (age, gender, ethnicity, and body weight) and clinical data (causes of hospitalization, use of antibiotics, and clinical outcome). Descriptive statistics was used to present the data. Of the 318 participants included in the study, 61.3% were male patients. The age range varied between 2 and 11 years, with mean age of 5.8±2.9 years. The prevalence of antibiotics was 24.4% out of the 1,346 hospitalized children. Median hospital stay was four days. The main cause of hospitalization was clinical instability, and the most commonly prescribed antibiotics was Cefazolin, mostly administered intravenously. Regarding the administration of antibiotics, 62.2% were adequately prescribed, even though underdose was 11.7%, and overdose was 14.6% in the studied patients. Antibiotic administration intervals were characterized as long in 8% of cases, and short in 3.5% of cases. Although the prevalence of antibiotics among hospitalized children was not that high, a considerable part of the sample presented inadequacy regarding the dosage and range of use. These data raise concerns about bacterial resistance and adverse reactions.
30066821	To assess the association between traumatic fractures and glucocorticoids taken 12 months prior to a trauma, in children and adolescents seen at an emergency room. A case-control study was conducted from April to October 2015, at a pediatric emergency hospital with patients aged 3- to 14 years-old, who had suffered physical trauma. Some of the patients had a fracture and some did not. The data analyzed were obtained from medical records, physical examination of the patients, and interview with the patients' caregivers. Glucocorticoid use in the past 12 months, demographic variables, body mass index, milk intake, trauma intensity, physical activity and smoking in the household were compared between the two patient groups. A total of 104 patients with physical trauma were studied - 50 had a fracture and 54 did not. Of all the patients, 15.4% had previously used glucocorticoids, and there were no statistically significant differences between the groups. The age range of 10- to 14 years-old, severe trauma and physical activity were more prevalent among patients with a bone fracture. This study did not find an association between previous glucocorticoid use and the occurrence of fractures in children and adolescents. The age range of 10- to 14 years-old, severe trauma, and physical activity were associated with an increased risk for fractures.
30066822	To analyze clinical, laboratory and histopathological features and the path to diagnosis establishment and treatment of patients with adrenal carcinoma (AC). Retrospective study with 13 patients assisted at the pediatric oncology service of Hospital das Clínicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Brazil, between 2004 and 2015. Age at diagnosis ranged from 1.0 to 14.8 years (median: 2.0 years). Manifestations of hypercortisolism were identified in all cases and virilization in all girls. All patients met the Weiss criteria to AC histopathological diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry was performed in 61.5% of the cases. Most patients had stage I disease (76.9%). All subjects were submitted to total tumor resection. Two patients (stages III and IV disease) received chemotherapy associated to mitotane. The only death case was that of a patient with stage IV disease. The probability of overall survival for the entire group up to 5.0 years was 92.3±7.4%. The median time between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis was 9.5 months, and 6.0 months between first visit and start of treatment. Low age at diagnosis, predominance of cases with localized disease and complete tumor resection - with only one case of tumor capsule rupture - can possibly explain the favorable evolution of the studied population. The long period between onset of symptoms and diagnosis highlights the importance of training pediatricians for early recognition of AC signs and symptoms.
30066823	To establish waist circumference cut off points according to pubertal staging to identify overweight in adolescents. Longitudinal study approved by the Ethics Research Committee and conducted with 557 adolescents, aged 10 to 15 years old, selected from public schools. Waist, arm, neck and hip circumferences, body fat percentage, body mass index (BMI), height and blood pressure were measured. Pubertal staging was evaluated by Tanner self assessment scale. The Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC curve) was used to determine predictive power, sensitivity, specificity and waist circumference cut off points to detect overweight. There was a positive correlation between waist circumference and weight, BMI, upper arm and hip circumferences, waist-to-hip ratio and blood pressure in both sexes. Cut off points for waist circumference according to pubertal stage as related to overweight in adolescents with the best performances in ROC curve were: 71.65 cm for prepubescent girls, 67.90 cm for pubescent girls, 70.25 cm for post pubescent girls, and 66.45 cm for pubescent boys. Age, weight, height, BMI, body fat percentage, arm and hip circumferences were associated to altered waist circumference. The establishment of cut off points for waist circumference according to pubertal staging was proven a good means to identify overweight. These cut off points can be considered reliable for the Brazilian adolescent population, as the isolated use of chronological age in adolescents may underestimate their nutritional status.
34075261	Digital global connectivity offers multinational enterprises new opportunities, but it also brings unique risks, an area not yet well examined in international business. This article presents an organizational information-processing framework, which elucidates what (risk types and sources), how (risk assessing and managing), and whom (vulnerable firms) these risks relate to, in a dialectical manner that seeks to combine theoretical insights and managerial actions. We focus on three types of risks (digital interdependence, information security, and regulatory complexity) that MNEs uniquely face, and explain within-country and cross-country risk drivers. We document variances among MNEs in exposure to these risks, proposing that information flow intensity, geographic diversity, international strategy, and global platform participation carry strong implications on the firm's risk exposure and response. Finally, this framework offers actions essential for MNEs, individually and collectively, to manage digital risks, emphasizing processes of building and deploying digital intelligence in pursuit of transnational resilience for cross-border activities that become increasingly digitally connected.
34076063	Hypertensive patients undergoing treatment and assessed only by casual blood pressure (BP) measurement may be subject to mistaken decisions. To assess BP behavior by measuring its levels at the office (casual) and at home (HBPM), the behavior of different classes of antihypertensive drugs, and the prevalence of uncontrolled white-coat hypertension (UCWCH) and uncontrolled masked hypertension (UCMH). Cross-sectional study assessing patients who underwent BP monitoring in the TeleMRPA platform between 2017 and 2019. The exclusion criteria were: use of no antihypertensive drug; combined use of 3 or more antihypertensive drugs; and use of spironolactone and alpha-2 agonist. The variables analyzed were: age, sex, body mass index (BMI), number of valid BP measurements, means of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively) obtained from HBPM and casual measurement, and the classes of antihypertensive drugs. Paired and unpaired t tests, as well as chi-square test, were used. The 5% significance level was adopted. This study selected 22 446 patients, 6731 of whom met the inclusion criteria [61.3%, female sex; mean age, 57.8 (±12.6) years; mean BMI, 29.0 (±5.1) kg/m2]. Mean SBP and DBP were 6.6 mm Hg (p<0.001) and 4.4 mm Hg (p<0.001) higher in casual measurement than in HBPM. The rates of BP control were 57.0% in casual measurement and 61.3% in HBPM (p<0.001), and the prevalence of UCWCH and UCMH was 15.4% and 11.1%, respectively. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade was observed in 74.6% of the patients, and 54.8% were on single-drug therapy. HBPM should be considered for the follow-up of treated hypertensive patients because of the high prevalence of UCWCH and UCMH. Antihypertensive drugs behaved differently in HBPM. (Arq Bras Cardiol. 2021; [online].ahead print, PP.0-0).
34076064	The beneficial effects of Elabela on the cardiovascular system have been shown in studies. To compare serum Elabela levels of chronic total occlusion (CTO) patients with control patients with normal coronary arteries, and to investigate whether there is a correlation with collateral development. The study was planned cross-sectionally and prospectively. Fifty patients (28.0% female, mean age 61.6±7.3years) with CTO in at least one coronary vessel and 50 patients (38% female, mean age 60,7±6.38 years) with normal coronary arteries were included in the study. Patients in the CTO group were divided into two groups as Rentrop 0-1, those with weak collateral development, and Rentrop 2-3 with good collateral development. In addition to the age, sex, demographic characteristics and routine laboratory tests of the patients, Elabela levels were measured. Demographic characteristics and laboratory values were similar in both groups. While the mean NT-proBNP and troponin were higher in the CTO group, the Elabela mean was lower (p <0.05 for all). In the multivariate regression analysis, NT-proBNP and Elabela levels were found to be independent predictors for CTO. Also, Elabela level was found to be statistically higher in Rentrop class 2-3 patients compared to Rentrop class 0-1 patients (p<0.05). In our study, we showed that the average Elabela level was low in CTO patients compared to normal patients. In addition, we found the level of Elabela to be lower in patients with weak collateral development compared to patients with good collateral development. (Arq Bras Cardiol. 2021; [online].ahead print, PP.0-0).
34076089	To identify factors associated with a higher probability of survival for men aged 60 and over in the course of almost 15 years. Prospective cohort study, where time zero is the year 2000 and deaths (final event) were measured until November 2014. The independent variables were obtained from personal characteristics, childhood life, educational status, lifestyle, social support, work history, socioeconomic situation, and health condition. At the end of the period, 25.8% of elderly men remained alive and the factors that stood out associated with a higher probability of survival were: performing 50% or more of the Basic and/or Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (95%CI 0.41 - 0.64), being the head of the family (95%CI 0.42 - 0.82), participating in the community (95%CI 0.52 - 0.88), working on their own (95%CI 0.54 - 0.88), and owning a home and goods (95%CI 0.56 - 0.92). Characteristics related to a greater autonomy of the elderly men, even after almost 15 years, contributed to an increase in the probability of survival.
34076090	To analyze the different profiles of dental service use by the Brazilian elderly and their possible association with sociodemographic factors, comorbidities, functionality and self-perception of oral health. Cross-sectional population-based study, using secondary data from the National Health Survey (PNS) of 2013. The sample size was 2,969 elderly individuals. Latent Class Analysis was used to construct the dependent variable 'profile of dental service use' from questions related to this profile. The independent variables formed 3 blocks: sociodemographic; comorbidities; functionalities and self-perception of oral health. The Rao-Scott Test and Standardized Residue Analysis tested the association. To measure the effect of covariates, Odds Ratio was estimated using a multiple hierarchical model of multinomial logistic regression. Significance level was 5%. Three latent classes were identified: Direct Disbursement Profile, Health Plan Profile and the Unified Health System (SUS) Profile. White elderly people were associated with the Direct Disbursement and Health Plans profile. The Health Plan profile was more associated with the married marital status or living with a spouse. In the multiple model, low schooling was associated with the profile of SUS users and elderly people diagnosed with cancer with the Health Plan profile. Self-perceiving oral health as bad or very bad increased the chances of belonging to the SUS profile. Latent Class Analysis proved to be a powerful strategy for a subtle and detailed understanding of the profile of dental service use and its relationship with associated factors.
34076095	Diabetes mellitus is one of the most prevalent diseases worldwide and is among the leading causes of loss of healthy years of life, which is aggravated in Brazil by accelerated population aging. This study aims to measure the problem of diabetes mellitus and its complications and characterize healthcare for diabetics in Brazil, according to regions. Prevalence rates were estimated using a multinomial regression model, and characterization of healthcare was based on triangulation between the Brazilian National Health Survey (PNS), the National Program for Improving Access and Quality in Primary Care (PMAQ-AB), and data from the Popular Pharmacy program. Diabetes prevalence in Brazil was 9.2%, according to the multinomial model, and prevalence in the corrected PNS (self-report + altered glycated hemoglobin - HbA1c ≥ 6.5) was 9.4%. The proportion of diabetes mellitus underreporting in the country was 42.5%, reaching 72.8% in the North. Among individuals diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, half presented HbA1c ≥ 6.5. Insufficient fundus eye examination (only 40% on average), with major regional variation (North 25% - Southeast 52%), is reflected in the high prevalence of retinopathy. Insufficient examination of feet (only 30%), can lead to more amputations. About 80% of diabetics used medications, indicating a persistently high proportion still without treatment. Healthcare deficiencies for diabetics lead to greater morbidity, hospitalizations (15%), and visits to emergency departments (27%, PMAQ). The scenario in 2012, although not ideal, occurred in a context of strengthening of the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS). The growing prevalence of diabetes mellitus and cutbacks in public health budgeting call for serious reflection on control of the disease in the coming years.
34076098	Colorectal cancer presents high incidence worldwide, but case-fatality is higher in developing countries. The study's objective was to analyze sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with delay in the initiation of treatment for colorectal cancer in hospitals in Brazil. This is a retrospective study of data from hospital cancer registries in Brazil from 2006 to 2015. The target variable is time to initiation of treatment for colorectal cancer and possible associations between sociodemographic variables and clinical factors. The analysis revealed disparities in time to treatment according to sociodemographic strata and geographic regions. Higher odds of treatment delay were associated with age over 50 years, black race/color (OR = 1.50; 95%CI: 1.21-1.84) and brown race/color (OR = 1.28; 95%CI: 1.17-1.42), illiteracy or low schooling (OR = 1.50; 95%CI: 1.19-1.90), and treatment in a city far from the patient's residence (OR = 1.25; 95%CI: 1.14-1.38). For rectal cancer, higher odds of treatment delay were associated with age over 50 years, black (OR = 1.44; 95%CI: 1.20-1.72) or brown race/color (OR = 1.29; 95%CI: 1.19-1.39), illiteracy or low schooling (OR = 1.71; 95%CI: 1.40-2.09), and treatment in a city far from the patient's residence (OR = 1.35; 95%CI: 1.25-1.47). In conclusion, greater attention should be given to reducing the time to initiation of treatment in underprivileged regions and in social strata identified with barriers to timely treatment access.
34076099	Recent decades have witnessed important transformations in public services that involve changes in the State's role as central agent in the regulation of public-private relations and the definition of levels of public financing. Health system reform proposals are part of the process of social transformations that have affected various nations. However, changes in the linkage between different dimensions are the result of both broad processes of social transformation and specific experiences and timelines, essential for understanding the results of this process. In recent decades, the British National Health Service (NHS) underwent the most important reform process since its creation in 1948. This process began with a set of measures implemented by the Conservative government in 1991, which were continued through alterations introduced in 1997 and 2002. An analysis of the NHS reform not only provides elements for understanding the current debate sparked by the initiatives led by Boris Johnson and aimed at a new NHS reform starting in 2021; such analysis also allows identifying convergences with other reform proposals in public health systems that were shaped under inspiration from the British model, as in the case of Brazil. The current article aims to discuss and analyse a case of health system reform that can be considered paradigmatic for the development of major trends in this field. The article seeks to specifically analyse the reform processes carried out since the 1990s in the NHS and their consequences for the health system's restructuring.
34076100	The experiences of homeless pregnant women create tensions in the public debate between individual guarantees and limits on State interventions. This article analyzes the scientific research on this issue, focusing on the biomedical, legal, and social arguments backing the positions in this debate. Based on an integrative review of Brazilian and international databases, the authors analyzed 21 studies and identified four propositions: Health risks for the woman and the fetus/child; Discourses on prenatal care; Rights of women and fetuses/children; and Meanings of motherhood. The article concludes that the experience of motherhood for these women is extremely complex, not only because of their homelessness, but due to the entire context, marked by unequal class, race, and gender relations. The Brazilian and international scenario features a discourse of protection and care for the fetus/infant that overrides care for the mother. The criminalization of homeless women's motherhood has been a global trend in which the expansion of 'fetal/infant' rights translates as a cutback in the women's rights. Such an approach fails to encourage homeless women to seek social and health services, rather discouraging them from doing so. An ethical and humanitarian imperative is to conceive different approaches to care, grounded in a human rights perspective so that care for the fetus/child does not translate as violence against the mother.
34076101	To present a proposal for speech-language pathology rehabilitation called the Therapy Program for Management of Chronic Cough (TMCC) for the treatment of refractory chronic cough. TMCC was developed based on two stages: literature and clinical analysis. The literature analysis stage was carried out through the following procedures: electronic and manual search for articles and books published until June 2019 that included adult participants with chronic cough and intervention with speech-language pathology therapy; selection of sources; analysis of articles and books included; and, preparation of the initial version of the therapy program. The initial version of the therapy program resulting from literature analysis stage was submitted to clinical analysis stage through the following procedures: analysis by three judges; revision of the proposal by the authors; judges' re-analysis; elaboration of the final version called the Therapy Program for Management of Chronic Cough (TMCC). TMCC synthesizes scientific knowledge and current clinical experience on the behavioral management of refractory chronic cough into a program with three main components, each one with specific objectives and strategies. TMCC consists of four sessions, with weekly frequency and duration between 30-45 minutes per session, executed in hierarchical phases, with specific objectives and strategies per session. TMCC is a program structured to offer global cough rehabilitation. To obtain scientific evidence about its effectiveness is necessary, so that it can be used in clinical practice.
34076103	Sea people are culturally differentiated by their way of life intertwined with sea fishing and their social and symbolic production. In northeastern Brazil, these people have been changing their living conditions. The Family Health Strategy (ESF) should strengthen links with different cultures to meet its basic principles. We aimed to reflect on the challenges of the ESF in the context of sea people. We conducted ethnographic research in the community of Redonda, Icapuí, State of Ceará, using dense descriptions constructed through the narratives of small-scale fishers and their families. We analyzed from the theoretical approach of studies in traditional communities. The results are shown in five themes: 1) The family has an extended dimension in communities established with relatives; 2) Fishing life temporalities govern the common acts of the land-sea dyad; 3) The shifts between being 'native' and 'outsider' create border areas that dialogue with the rituals of belonging; 4) Sea territorialization and the knowledge of experience; 5) The ESF in the arenas of struggles for environmental justice. Here, the production of health is reaffirmed as the production of sea people's life.
34076104	This research aimed to analyze the dwellers' knowledge of the territories, Pecém Port and Industrial Compound (CIPP), the quality of life of the communities living in the vicinity of the enterprises, and the prevalence of hypertension and overweight. This is a home-based, epidemiological survey of four areas of the Family Health Strategy (ESF) in São Gonçalo do Amarante and one area of the ESF in Caucaia, Ceará, Brazil. The study was carried out between 10/2017 and 03/2018. Anthropometric and blood pressure measurements were performed, and sociodemographic data and knowledge about community, the CIPP, and quality of life were collected. A total of 69.8% of the 503 adults interviewed were female, and the mean age was 44 years. Parada was the area reporting the highest percentage of problems related to air particles (51.1%), the worst concept regarding the CIPP (40.1% bad), the highest percentage of worse quality of life (29, 1%), and greater desire to move to another place (31.5%). Pecém had the highest percentage of community problems related to violence, consumption of illicit drugs, and prostitution. We concluded that there are signs of impact on local populations' health and quality of life without more significant direct work/income benefits.
34076105	This study assessed the Family Health Strategy (ESF) health care accessibility in the municipal system, which is the health macro-region headquarters in Bahia. It consisted of two levels of analysis: the municipal management and the local organization of ESF teams. Data production combined documentary analysis, non-participant observation, and interviews with managers, professionals, and users. Goal-image was used with evaluative criteria and dimensions of the accessibility in Primary Care. Family Health Teams (EqSF) still do not entirely fulfill the role of preferential contact in municipal health services, and the health care accessibility reflects the interdependence of municipal and local factors. Rural and peripheral teams performed better in organizational accessibility, and central urban teams performed better in geographic accessibility. The assessment focused on geographic and organizational criteria, combining different sources of evidence and health system players using analysis levels considering the municipal and local PHC management are relevant contributions of this study, which can be extended to other municipal systems with similar characteristics.
34076106	The work of Community Health Workers (ACS) was analyzed in light of Communities of Practice (CP) theory. This is a qualitative cross-sectional study carried out in four municipalities in Ceará. Six focus groups and six interviews were carried out with 45 Community Health Workers (ACS), observing ethical aspects. The data corpus was analyzed using the content analysis technique. The results show that ACS participation in the ESF is marked by experience in the community, and the main focus is monitoring priority groups. The practices put them before the diverse social and family complexities, generating reflections and building new meanings for themselves and their work process. The ACS CPs engage and share challenges and unique learning from work, characterized by close contact and relationships with the families of the territory, which reveals needs hardly perceived by other ESF professionals. The meaning of being ACS as one who listens, embraces, and perceives the needs of families invisible to services, is evident in the reification processes. The ACS better exercise their role as ESF articulators in the territories the greater the spaces for dialogue between them, the other team members, and management.
34076107	Community-based and workplace violence against health professionals has caused feelings of vulnerability, emotional exhaustion, and psychological changes, reflecting on sleep quality disorders. Thus, we aimed to analyze the association between community and workplace violence and the sleep quality of health professionals working in primary health care. The study was conducted with 286 health professionals who worked in PHC in one of the largest cities in Brazil. The primary outcome was sleep quality as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Most of the participants (69.2%/p=0.074) were classified as 'bad sleepers', and nurses (73.3%/p=0.049) showed the worst sleep quality. Additionally, most professionals suffered some type of violence at work (p<0.001), which impaired professional activities (p=0.010), forcing them to change their behavior (p<0.001) and consider changing the workplace location (p=0.051). The results showed that professionals have been experiencing moments of fear, anxiety, and stress associated with workplace and community violence. This highlights the need for public policies geared to occupational health.
34076108	The study aimed to investigate the perception of doctors about the different hiring methods and their influence on the performance of the PHC essential attributes to analyze the formats that best contribute to its implementation and strengthening. This is a quantitative, cross-sectional research using a semi-structured form with 268 doctors from the ESF in Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil. A unique sociodemographic profile was identified for each group evaluated, influencing the work process and opinions about hiring formats. The development of the essential PHC attributes was positively evaluated, but different perceptions were observed by professional hiring method assessed. The work performed by doctors in the ESF is influenced by how they are hired (p<0.001). Better performance of the statutory (4.4) was noted, followed by scholarship holders of the Mais Médicos Program/Primary Care Valorization Program (3.7), Consolidated Labor Laws (3.5), and, finally, those working with Self-Employed Payment Receipt (RPA) (2.4). We analyzed that hiring through the Brazilian Statutory Regime and RPA are, respectively, the best (85%) and the worst (96.6%) hiring formats.
34076109	The populations of lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transvestites, and transsexuals (LGBTT) have not had a place in the 'official history' of humanity, except as secondary actors that deviate, distort, or even tarnish popular memory, guided by cisheteronormativity. These same subjects often experience obstacles in the care provided by the Family Health Strategy (ESF) within a universal, comprehensive, and equitable system. This paper seeks to analyze experiences narrated by primary care professionals in health care for LGBTT populations in Teresina, Piauí, Brazil. This is qualitative research conducted with 32 professionals working at a PHC unit. The analysis was based on three dimensions - relational, organizational, and contextual - inspired by the Giovanella and Fleury theoretical discussion. Primary care, which should be one of those responsible for community health actions and prioritize health promotion and prevention, is the same that has provided denials, violence, and neglect in the care of LGBTT people. Therefore, we selected listening as one of the keys to respecting sexual and gender diversity so that these people are recognized as ESF users.
34076110	This study aimed to develop a prototype of the GISSA Mother-Baby ChatBot Application (GCBMB), a conversational agent to promote child health and evaluate the experience of use and satisfaction with this technological solution. This is a two-stage cross-sectional research with a mixed methodology. The first stage develops the settings of dialogue and the GCBMB prototype. The second stage evaluates the experience of using the ChatBot through a structured questionnaire where statements are used to assess the respondent's level of agreement using the Likert Scale and analyzes the application's use path through its database. The sample consisted of 142 puerperae, with a mean age of 25.4 years, where 38.1% were primiparous. The level of agreement of women with simplicity, good quality of information, clarity of content, usefulness, and satisfaction with the application was above 90%. Women between 26 and 30 years of age had a higher mean number of hits (5.21), settings accessed (9.26), and usage time (272 seconds) comparing younger and older women. The use of ChatBots on smartphones is encouraging to promote the health of children in Brazil. However, more investments are required to improve technological solutions and research with robust methodologies to evaluate their effectiveness.
34076111	Self-care is encouraged in the type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM1) setting. Thus, this research aimed to develop and validate a mobile application (APP) to promote self-care for adolescents with DM1. The method was divided into two stages: development and validation, ranging from literature review, benchmarking, prototype construction to validation by specialists. The APP construction was subsidized by the seven steps proposed by the American Association of Diabetes Educators. The screens were designed and possible functions were selected. After the design, the APP prototype was developed and named 'DM Agendinha'. The content validation process was mediated by the Suitability Assessment of Materials tool, where the percentage obtained was 85.3%, characterizing the APP as 'Superior Material'. The Smartphone Usability questionnaire was employed for technical validation, and the APP reached a global Content Validity Index of 0.96. We concluded, therefore, that the use of this material by adolescents will favor the acquisition of new knowledge and adherence to healthy practices, considering that it is a highly intelligible electronic technology.
34076112	The LARIISA collaborators group has been conducting research and development of technological solutions to support decision-making in health systems since 2009. GISSA, a cloud system resulting from the scientific and technological evolution of the LARIISA project, is among the solutions produced. This paper aims to describe the developing trend of GISSA©, a technological tool supporting the Family Health Strategy in northeastern Brazil, pointing out challenges, paths, and potentialities. This is a descriptive and exploratory study, based on secondary sources from the IBGE, INMET, SINAN, SIM, and SINASC, with quantitative analysis based on machine-learning techniques applied to create digital health microservices. Operating in the northeast and southeast regions, GISSA© provides information that qualifies health managers' decision-making process, improving the municipal health system's management.
34076113	Brazilian postgraduate education has grown in recent years, but there is a knowledge gap regarding whether the course's planned educational objective is being achieved. We aimed to evaluate the contribution of the Postgraduate Program in Family Health for the postgraduates' professional practice. This is a cross-sectional study conducted with 225 postgraduates from October 2019 to July 2020. Data were collected by an online questionnaire containing different sociodemographic and educational variables and competencies developed in the master's degree program and identifying the domains of Health Promotion Competencies. Most of the participants were female (78.2%), nurses (58.2%), public servants (64%), and SUS workers (93.3%). Two hundred and twenty-two (98.7%) postgraduates' final paper theme built on a practice-related issue. A high mean score was observed for all competencies analyzed. The mean scores for domains in Health Promotion competencies were high. We can conclude that the postgraduate program has contributed satisfactorily to the formation of critical, active masters, with competencies developed and being realized in professional practice.
34076114	The scope of this study is to discuss equity and access to mental health care by means of analysis of the distribution of primary care teams (Community Health Agents; Family Health Teams; the Expanded Family Health Nucleus) and the coverage of the Psychosocial Care Network in three Northeastern states (Ceará, Piauí and Rio Grande do Norte) and their respective health regions. It is a descriptive study, supported by exploratory quantitative analysis. For this purpose, the database of the Department of Basic Care/DATASUS was used to collect secondary data in relation to the historical trajectory of training of Primary Care teams. Regarding the points of care of RAPS, the database made available by the National Mental Health Coordination of the Ministry of Health was consulted. The conclusion of the investigation was that prior to 2018 there was a major drive in the country into the interior and expansion of coverage in relation to primary and psychosocial care, impacting the expansion of equity in territories of lesser economic and social development. However, it was also observed that Psychosocial Care Network services are more prevalent in the interior while the other related services are more developed in capitals and large municipalities.
34076115	The Family Health Strategy (FHS) of the Unified Health System (SUS) is the revised model that governs health care and the work processes adopted in Brazil. This article analyzes the perceptions of FHS professionals regarding mental health and the care provided in a health center in a Basic Care Unit in the Brazilian Northeast. It involved qualitative research aligned with a critical interpretative approach conducted through interviews, straightforward observation and documentary analysis that led to a series of considerations organized into two main groups: a) 'Mental Health' from the perspective of professionals of the FHS; and b) Care in 'Mental Health' in the context of practices of primary care. The results of the study reveal conceptions about mental health limited to a view aligned with a project of institutionalization and medicalization. With respect to the dimension of care, gaps are revealed in relation to shared experiences in mental health, through the incipient partnership between professionals of the FHS and the Nucleus of Support in Family Health (NSFH). The challenge remains to reconstruct a vision aligned with the precepts of Brazilian psychiatric reform, teamwork and the creation of spaces that enable discussion and agreements in the daily routine of the FHS.
34076116	This paper aims to describe the indicators related to planning and support in the work process reported by the Family Health Teams, from the 3rd cycle of the National Program for Improving Access and Quality of Primary Care (PMAQ-AB) in the Brazilian Northeast. This cross-sectional study employed secondary data from the external evaluation of the 3rd cycle of the PMAQ-AB. Sixteen indicators were used to ascertain the teams' work process actions, and 14,489 family health teams that adhered to the program were evaluated. Among the indicators assessed, we found that the teams held a meeting and planned actions and self-evaluated, monitored, and analyzed health indicators to reorganize the work process, highlighting the determining and conditioning factors. Health surveillance and the Extended Family Health Center (NASF) stand out in the indicators of institutional support and multidisciplinary support for solving complex cases. We identified improvements in the work process of the teams in the Northeast region, but the reality of fragmented and vertical work still requires a change to promote an outlook of shared teamwork, directly influencing the work process.
34076117	The scope of this article is to compare the assessment of users of health services who participated in the PMAQ-AB on child health in the states of the Brazilian Northeast. It is a cross-sectional study conducted with secondary data based on interviews with 5,116 users of 4,190 Family Health Teams in the nine states of the Northeast macroregion. Fourteen questions on the medical monitoring of children from 0 to 2 years old were evaluated. Proportions and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each Unit of the Federation of the Brazilian Northeast. The indicators with the highest proportions were the Guthrie PKU test performed within seven days of life (84.4%), children always accompanied by the same professionals (79.1%), monitoring expected growth and development for age (84.9%), dietary guidance (86.3%) and up-to-date vaccination (95.3%). The indicators with the lowest proportions were guidance on the best position for the child to sleep in (45.7%) and whether or not the child's health handbook (46.9%) was received. In all indicators, there were significant differences between the states analyzed. There are differences in the quality of child health care on offer according to the evaluation of users participating in the PMAQ-AB between states in the Northeast.
34076118	The scope of this article is to evaluate the structure and work processes of Family Health Strategy teams related to the nutritional care of children. It involved an assessment survey of 136 health teams in 45 municipalities in the State of Paraíba. The data on structure (availability of anthropometric equipment, supplements and technical documents) and processes (management, intersectoriality and activities of the Brazilian Breastfeeding and Feeding Strategy) were summarized in scores and classified as incipient, intermediate or advanced. Analyses were performed according to contextual characteristics of the municipality (population size and human development) and the health team (whether from the Programa Mais Médicos or conventional teams, and whether accompanied by a nutritionist or not). Nutritional care was classified at the intermediate level, with the availability of technical documents, the use of SISVAN or the e-SUS and the implementation of the Brazilian Breastfeeding and Feeding Strategy being the most deficient items. Large municipalities and expanded health teams with nutritionists had better structure and process conditions, respectively. The fragmented implementation of nutritional care calls for improvements in structure and processes for due fitness for purpose.
34076119	The elderly population is vulnerable to the risks of the use of medications, especially those considered potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs), in which the risks outweigh the benefits. The study sought to evaluate the PIMs prescribed in Primary Health Care (PHC) and associated factors. A cross-sectional, analytical study was carried out from March to December 2019 in PHC in Campina Grande, Paraíba, through interviews with 458 elderly individuals. The independent variables included socioeconomic characteristics, health status and the use of medications, and the outcome was classified as PIM by the Brazilian Consensus on Potentially Inappropriate Medications. There was a prescription of at least one PIM for 44.8% of the elderly and the majority affecting the Central Nervous System (54.4%). In the adjusted model, depression (PR=2.01; 95%CI 1.59-2.55), using other medications in addition to those prescribed (PR=1.36; 95%CI 1.08-1.72) and polypharmacy (PR=1.80; 95%CI 1.40-2.33) remained an associated factor, and self-reporting systemic arterial hypertension became a protective factor (PR=0.65; 95%CI 0.49-0.87). This reveals the need for actions to monitor closely the use of PIMs by the elderly to ensure access in conjunction with safety.
34076120	This study aimed to identify the structuring elements guiding the establishment of the social representations of diabetic foot among people with diabetes mellitus. This qualitative study is based on the Social Representations Theory and was conducted in a capital of the Brazilian Northeast. The free word association test and a roadmap were used to characterize the sociodemographic and clinical profile to collect data. The analysis was performed using openEVOC software. The constituent elements of the diabetic foot's social representation 'cure' and 'really bad', revealing that living with a diabetic foot is challenging, but there is hope for a cure, which is a driving force in the daily search for care. The 'prevention' element emerged in the representational field, denoting a more critical view and a capacity to transform the identified core elements. We found that the representational structure is based on subjective, valuating, and attitudinal contents. This knowledge can contribute to the design of interventions in the provision of care and diabetic foot screening in PHC services.
34076121	This study aimed to describe the prevalence of leprosy and verify the factors associated with multibacillary clinical types in a Family Health Strategy priority setting to control and monitor the disease in northeastern Brazil. This cross-sectional study used data from the Notifiable Diseases Information System related to leprosy cases notified in Imperatriz, Maranhão, between 2008 and 2017. The prevalence was determined yearly and for the period. Poisson regression models with a significance level of 5% were employed to associate the variables and the multibacillary clinical types. Most of the 2,476 leprosy cases analyzed referred to multibacillary clinical types. The prevalence ranged from 7.8 and 15.6/10,000 inhabitants, with high and very high endemicity levels. The variables male, age groups between 30 and 59 years and ≥60 years, schooling <8 years, level 2 physical disability, types 1 and 2 reactive episodes, and urban residence area showed significant associations (p≤0.05) with multibacillary clinical types. Such findings can serve as a basis for elaborating and implementing leprosy control and surveillance measures, gearing actions to the most vulnerable groups, and becoming more effective.
34076122	In this interview, public health physician Antônio Carlile Holanda Lavor with 57-year career and long and broad experience in the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) management, especially in primary health care, talks about his management at the head of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation unit in Ceará (Fiocruz-CE), from 2008 to the present moment. Known internationally for institutionalizing the Health Worker Program in Ceará in 1987, he discusses the process of implementing Fiocruz-CE and the role of research in guiding the work of the Family Health Strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic.
34076123	The objective was to ve rify the association between sexual maturation and physical activity during adolescence. A systematic review of articles published between 2008 and 2018 was conducted using the following databases: PubMed/Medline, SciELO, Web of Science, Scopus, Lilacs, and BVS Adolec Brasil. The following descriptors and keywords were used in English and Portuguese: adolescent, sexual maturation, survey, questionnaire, and physical activity. The literature search retrieved 806 articles. Twelve articles were included after applying the selection criteria. Level of physical activity was highest in the initial stage of sexual maturation. Levels of physical activity appear to decrease with advancing sexual maturation status. There is no consensus about the association between sexual maturation and physical activity levels among adolescents within the literature reviewed by this study. Further research is needed to investigate whether this relationship exists and professionals involved in healthcare for adolescents should take effective steps to combat physical inactivity.
34076125	The text presents and discusses the main aspects related to the current dynamics of the vaccine industry in the world and in Brazil, focusing on the demand created by the pandemic of COVID-19. At the global level, it briefly exposes the place currently occupied by Brazil within the scope of the BRICS and sets out and analyzes the options - identities and differences - of industrial policy in Brazil, China and India in the field of vaccines. Next, it analyzes the displacement of the vaccine industry, from a situation of exclusive production of immunizers to a majority control by the large pharmaceutical industry. Further on, it recovers recent fundamental aspects of the vaccine industry in Brazil, with an emphasis on Biomanguinhos / Fiocruz and the Butantan Institute. Finally, it discusses the successes and limitations of the technology transfer mechanism used by the two institutions, as well as the relevance of their historically assumed commitment to public health policies.
34076126	This essay reflects on sexual practices and prevention in the contexts of the AIDS and COVID-19 pandemics. It analyses data collected between July and October 2020 through participant observation, as part of an ethnographic research project on HIV vulnerability and prevention among men who have sex with men in the Metropolitan Region of Recife, state of Pernambuco (PE), Brazil. The results point to the relevance of physical appearance and the affective bond between partners in engendering emotions that mediate coping with the risk of infection during both pandemics. It indicates the need to incorporate those communicational dimensions into informational materials to make them more effective.
34076127	This study sought to assess the adherence to preventive measures among the elderly more prone to severe forms of COVID-19, and the association and interaction with social support. It is a cross-sectional study conducted with a sample of 3,477 participants of the telephone survey of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-COVID-19 initiative), who reported going out of the home in the past week. The adherence was based on the frequency of leaving the house, the need to venture outside the home, use of masks, and sanitization of hands. Statistical analysis was based on the Poisson model with robust variance. Predisposing factors for severe forms of COVID-19 included age ≥65 years, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Social support included living arrangements and social distancing during the pandemic. Approximately 46% of the participants showed higher adherence, which was positively associated with the number of predisposing factors for severe forms of COVID-19. Social support was not associated with adherence, nor was this association modified after adjustments. The conclusion drawn is that higher adherence is concentrated among the elderly with greater predisposition to severe forms of COVID-19, irrespective of social support, albeit preventive measures should be adopted by all.
34076129	This article explores the use of spatial artificial intelligence to estimate the resources needed to implement Brazil's COVID-19 immu nization campaign. Using secondary data, we conducted a cross-sectional ecological study adop ting a time-series design. The unit of analysis was Brazil's primary care centers (PCCs). A four-step analysis was performed to estimate the popula tion in PCC catchment areas using artificial in telligence algorithms and satellite imagery. We also assessed internet access in each PCC and con ducted a space-time cluster analysis of trends in cases of SARS linked to COVID-19 at municipal level. Around 18% of Brazil's elderly population live more than 4 kilometer from a vaccination point. A total of 4,790 municipalities showed an upward trend in SARS cases. The number of PCCs located more than 5 kilometer from cell towers was largest in the North and Northeast regions. Innovative stra tegies are needed to address the challenges posed by the implementation of the country's National COVID-19 Vaccination Plan. The use of spatial artificial intelligence-based methodologies can help improve the country's COVID-19 response.
34076131	This article discusses health problems due to firearm injuries suffered on duty military police officers in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro (RJ). Medical records analysis was con ducted referring to military police officers who were treated at the Military Police's Central Hos pital (MPCH) due to gunshot wounds from June 2015 to December 2017 according to professional profile, the characteristics of the event and the le sion, the spatial distribution of the incidents in volving gunshot wounds, and the healthcare units involved in their care. Firearms injured four hun dred seventy-five military police officers: 98.3% were male, 77.3% were in service, 97.9% were soldier personnel. As to the anatomical location of the wounds, the most affected regions were: lower (41.1%) and superior (33.1%) limbs, the head neck-face region (23.5%), and thorax-abdomen (3%). The areas in the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro with the highest occurrence of firearm morbidity are program areas 3 and 1 and the Baixada Fluminense. There is a correlation between police morbidity rates due to firearm injuries in the municipalities of the metropolitan region and demographic density (p = 0.024).
34076133	To analyze the network of correlations between the realms of the Effor t-Reward Imbalance (ERI) model, resilience, and quality of life among military police officers. This is a cross-sectional study conducted with 258 police officers from the Special Opera tions Battalion of the Military Police in a city in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The scales of the ERI model, resilience, and World Health Quality of Life (WHOQOL-bref) assessed psychosocial stress, resilience, and quality of life. Descriptive and analytical statistics were performed em ploying the network analysis. The realms of the ERI model and resilience correlated with all the WHOQOL's realms (p<0.001). The network model showed a negative association between effort, overcommitment, and physical and environmental realms. The environmental realm was positively associated with reward, while resilience was positively associated with the general, physical, and psychological realms. We concluded that psychosocial stress interferes in the quality of life of military police officers, and resi lience may work as a protective factor.
34076134	The aim of this article is to assess the association between body image dissatisfaction and sociodemographic and health behaviors, according to sex. Data were analyzed for 6,289 women and 5,188 men (35-59 years), participants in the baseline of the Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil), using multinomial regression. The odds of dissatisfaction due to feeling underweight were higher among in women with low schooling and those who only consumed fruit weekly. Moderate physical activity reduced this type of dissatisfaction by 50%. Higher odds of dissatisfaction due to overweight were seen in married women, those who practiced light physical activity, and former smokers. Men with secondary schooling and excessive alcohol consumption showed 50% higher odds of dissatisfaction due to underweight, while light or moderate physical activity increased the odds by 75% and 94%, respectively. Among men, light and moderate physical activity were also associated with increased odds of dissatisfaction due to overweight. These findings corroborate that unhealthy habits and behaviors can influence body image dissatisfaction with different patterns between women and men.
34076135	This article aims to investigate the relationship between intimate partner physical violence (IPPV) and breastfeeding (BF), use of breastmilk substitutes (BMS) and bottle-feeding among children aged 12 to 15 months. This is a cross-sectional study with mothers in primary care facilities of the city of Rio de Janeiro. IPPV was identified by the Brazilian version of the Conflict Tactics Scales 1-Form R and feeding practices were identified by a 24-hour Dietary Recall. Associations were verified by logistic regression with odds ratio (OR) estimates and 95% confidence intervals. BF was offered to 58.5% of the children and BMS to 88.5%. Also, 70.5% of the children used a baby bottle. Physical violence was observed in 26.7% of couples. Households where couples physically abuse each other are more likely to not breastfeed (OR=2.14, p-value=0.030), to use breastmilk substitutes (OR=5.15, p-value=0.03) and bottle-feed (OR=2.71; p-value=0.01), when compared to households without physical violence. The results highlight the need to investigate intrafamily relationships in cases where inadequate breastfeeding practices are identified, and to enable health professionals to support families in conflict situations.
34076136	The scope of this study is to describe the food environment of a medium-sized municipality in southern Brazil and compare the availability of different types of food outlets in neighborhood socioeconomic and demographic environments. An ecological study was carried out in 45 buffers of 400m in São Leopoldo county, RS. The buffer was calculated from the center point of the residences of women participating in a larger research project. All streets were surveyed to identify food stores and record their geographical coordinates, as well as apply the NEMS questionnaire on the availability, price and quality of 108 items. The commercial outlets were classified as supermarkets, grocery stores, fruit stores and convenience stores. Supermarkets and grocery stores were present in higher quantity in lower income buffers and grocery stores were more prevalent in those with higher population tertiles. Another result was a direct relationship between NEMS and tertile income scores for supermarkets, grocery stores and fruit stores, and an indirect relationship for the same stores and population tertile. The availability of healthy food was higher in areas with higher income and lower numbers of inhabitants, indicating the need for better distribution of food stores and availability of varieties of food in the municipality.
34076137	The objectives of the study were to assess the prevalence of self-reported visual impairment among undergraduate students between 18 and 39 years of age at the Federal University of Pelotas, and to validate a question about visual impairment in a subsample of the participants. A cross-sectional study was conducted by asking the question 'Do you have any difficulty seeing up close and/or in the distance?' As the gold standard for the validation study, visual acuity (VA) was measured using the Snellen chart. Patients with VA less than 20/40 in either eye were considered to have reduced VA. The prevalence of self-reported visual impairment was 37.3% (95% CI: 35.1-39.6) and VA less than 20/40 in either eye was 6.9% (95% CI: 5.3-8.9). The question revealed sensitivity of 71.4% (95 CI: 57.8-82.7), specificity of 66.9% (95% CI: 63.4-70.2), positive predictive value of 13.8% (95% CI: 10.0-18.3), and negative predictive value of 96.9% (95% CI: 95,1-98.2). The results indicated a high prevalence of self-reported visual impairment among university students. The question showed reasonable sensitivity and specificity and high negative predictive value and may be used for screening for ophthalmological evaluation among young adult university students.
34076154	To identify the predictive capacity for mortality of the indexes Revised Trauma Score, Rapid Emergency Medicine Score, modified Rapid Emergency Medicine Score, and Simplified Acute Physiology Score III in blunt trauma victims hospitalized in an intensive care unit and compare their performance. Retrospective cohort of patients with blunt trauma in an intensive care unit from medical records. Receiver Operating Characteristic and a 95% confidence interval of the area under the curve were analyzed to compare results. Out of 165 analyzed patients, 66.7% have received surgical treatment. The mortality in the intensive care unit and in the hospital was 17.6% and 20.6%, respectively. For the mortality in the intensive care unit, the area under the curve varied from 0.672 to 0.738; however, better results have been observed in surgical patients (0.747 to 0.811). Similar results have been observed for in-hospital mortality. In all analyses, the areas under the curve of the indexes presented no significant difference. The accuracy of the severity indexes was moderate, with an improved performance when applied to surgical patients. The four indexes presented a similar prediction for the analyzed outcomes.
34076179	To compare the effect of non-nutritive sucking, 25% oral glucose and 25% oral glucose combined with non-nutritive sucking in pain relief in premature infants submitted to heel puncture for blood glucose monitoring. This is a randomized crossover clinical trial with 34 preterm infants who randomly received interventions: non-nutritive sucking, 25% oral glucose and the two interventions combined for three consecutive days in heel puncture for blood glucose monitoring. Assessment by the Premature Infant Pain Profile for 30 seconds before the intervention, called the baseline period and for 5 minutes after puncture. The combination of interventions made the premature infants return to baseline, with 1 minute and 30 seconds after heel puncture, promoting a 2.2% percentage reduction in the scale. Comparing the effect of isolated and combined interventions showed that, when offered in combination, preterm infants were able to return to baseline parameters more quickly. Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry: RBR-3gm6w5.
34076180	To analyze fake news about immunobiologicals using as reference vaccine hesitancy in the World Health Organization's 3Cs model (confidence, complacency and convenience). This is an exploratory qualitative research that used content analysis to analyze fake news on three national news-checking sites. Twenty fake news related to immunobiologicals were analyzed, with 55% published in 2018 and 63% related to yellow fever vaccine. From analysis of results, two empirical categories have emerged: Immunobiologicals have a potential risk of death/sequel; Immunobiologicals are ineffective. Fake news have the potential to produce vaccine hesitancy based on the 3Cs model. Therefore, it is necessary to rethink communicative health practices that do not underestimate the asymmetries and inequities that characterize the unequal Brazilian society. Considering that nursing is the largest workforce in immunization rooms, there is a need for professionals' engagement as an active vehicle of truthful information in immunobiologicals for the population.
34076209	To investigate factors associated with the notification of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), on the Notifiable Health Conditions Information System (SINAN) in Brazil. This was an ecological study to estimate the proportion of municipalities that had notified NIHL. Logistic regression models were used to identify associated factors. Between 2013-2015, 277 (5.0%) municipalities notified NIHL. Notification was more prevalent among municipalities in an Occupational Health Referral Center (CEREST) coverage area (OR=1.62 - 95%CI 1.02;2.59) or those that had a CEREST in their territory (OR=4.37 - 95CI% 2.75;6.93), those that were closer to the state capital (OR=1.43 - 95%CI 1.06;1.92) and those with a high human development index (OR=2.35 - 95%CI 1.16;4.75). Among the municipalities located in a CEREST coverage area, notification was more frequent when there was a speech-language-hearing professional in the team (OR=1.96 - 95%CI - 1.47;2.63) and when employee turnover was low (OR=1.88 - 95%CI 1.40;2.52). Contextual factors influence NIHL notification, particularly the presence of CERESTs and their qualification.
34076227	To analyze polypharmacy prevalence and associated factors in older adults living in Rio Branco, Acre, Brazil, in 2014. This was a cross-sectional population-based study using complex sampling with older adults. Polypharmacy was defined as concomitant use of five or more medications. Polypharmacy prevalence was 14.9% (95%CI 11.8;18.6), positively associated with females (OR=2.29 - 95%CI 1.41;3.74), white race/skin color (OR=1.61 - 95%CI 1.10;2.38), dependence (OR=1.65 - 95%CI 1.05;2.60), change in eating habits/dieting (OR=1.66 - 95%CI 1.16;2.36), hospitalization in the last 12 months (OR=1.61 - 95%CI 1.02;2.53) and presence of the following self-reported morbidities: systemic arterial hypertension (OR=2.40 - 95%CI 1.33;4.34), diabetes mellitus (OR=2.17 - 95%CI 1.23;3.84), osteoporosis (OR=2.92 - 95%CI 1.84;4.64) and heart problems (OR=2.94 - 95%CI 1.90;4.56). This study found that polypharmacy in the older adults was associated with demographic and health conditions.
34076228	To analyze aspects related to schistosomiasis positivity in an area of low prevalence in Brazil. This was a cross-sectional study, carried out in the first half of 2020, where we analyzed the proportion of positivity, according to the number of Kato-Katz slides, the diagnostic performance of the test and positivity estimates based on data from the Schistosomiasis Surveillance and Control Program Information System (SISPCE). 2,088 slides from 348 individuals were analyzed, with proportion of positivity of 11.8%, 26.7% and 31.0% for 1, 4 and 6 slides analyzed, respectively. There was excellent agreement (Kappa = 0.91) between the readings of 4 and 6 slides. The SISPCE data was estimated to be underreported by up to 2.1 times. Increasing the number of slides increased Kato-Katz positivity, which can contribute to maximizing the control of the disease as a Public Health problem.
34076229	To analyze prevalence and factors associated with intimate partner violence during pregnancy. This was a cross-sectional study, with data obtained through interviews conducted with pregnant women aged 10 to 49 years during the third trimester of pregnancy, living in Caxias, state of Maranhão, Brazil (2019-2020). The instrument of the World Health Organization Violence Against Women Study was used to identify violence. A hierarchical analysis was performed using multiple logistic regression. 233 pregnant women were interviewed. The prevalence of violence during pregnancy was 33.0%, with predominance of psychological violence (18.9%). In the final hierarchical model, women aged <20 years old (ORadj=2.09 - 95%CI 1.17;3.54) and illicit drug use by intimate partner (ORadj=8.78 - 95%CI 2.13;28.92) remained as factors associated with the outcome. Prevalence of violence during pregnancy was high, with illegal drug use by young women and their partners being factors associated with its occurrence.
34077986	To study a sample of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients for their gynecological/obstetric history and compare them to controls to determine their influences on number of pregnancies, menarche, menopause and reproductive years following RA onset.  This is a cross-sectional study of 122 RA patients and 126 controls. Patients and controls were questioned about age of menarche, age of menopause, number of pregnancies and abortions. Reproductive years were calculated as the difference between age at menopause and age at menarche. For comparison, we used the Mann-Whitney, unpaired <i>t</i>, chi-squared, and Spearman tests. The adopted significance was 5%.  In the RA patients with disease beginning in the postmenopausal years, the period of reproductive years (age at menopause - age of menarche) showed a positive correlation with age at disease onset (rho = 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.20-0.55 with <i>p</i> = 0.0008). The number of pregnancies was higher in patients with postmenopausal disease onset when compared with those with premenopausal disease onset (median of 3 with interquartile range [IQR] = 2-4 versus median of 2 with IQR = 1-3; <i>p</i> = 0.009), and RA patients had more pregnancies than controls (<i>p</i> = 0.0002).  The present study shows that, in our population, the duration of reproductive years and the number of pregnancies are linked to the onset of RA.
34077987	Most prenatal screening programs for toxoplasmosis use immunoassays in serum samples of pregnant women. Few studies assess the accuracy of screening tests in dried blood spots, which are of easy collection, storage, and transportation. The goals of the present study are to determine the performance and evaluate the agreement between an immunoassay of dried blood spots and a reference test in the serum of pregnant women from a population-based prenatal screening program for toxoplasmosis in Brazil.  A cross-sectional study was performed to compare the immunoassays Imunoscreen Toxoplasmose IgM and Imunoscreen Toxoplasmose IgG (Mbiolog Diagnósticos, Ltda., Contagem, Minas Gerais, Brazil)in dried blood spots with the enzyme-linked fluorescent assay (ELFA, BioMérieux S.A., Lyon, France) reference standard in the serum of pregnant women from Minas Gerais Congenital Toxoplasmosis Control Program.  The dried blood spot test was able to discriminate positive and negative results of pregnant women when compared with the reference test, with an accuracy of 98.2% for immunoglobulin G (IgG), and of 95.8% for immunoglobulin M (IgM).  Dried blood samples are easy to collect, store, and transport, and they have a good performance, making this a promising method for prenatal toxoplasmosis screening programs in countries with continental dimensions, limited resources, and a high prevalence of toxoplasmosis, as is the case of Brazil.
34077988	To evaluate the antitumoral role of γδ T<sub>DC</sub> cells and αβ T<sub>DC</sub> cells in an experimental model of breast cancer.  Thirty female Balb/c mice were divided into 2 groups: control group (<i>n</i> = 15) and induced-4T1 group (<i>n</i> = 15), in which the mice received 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> 4T1 mammary tumor cell line. Following the 28-day experimental period, immune cells were collected from the spleen and analyzed by flow cytometry for comparison of αβ T<sub>DC</sub> (TCRαβ<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup>MHCII<sup>+</sup>) and γδ T<sub>DC</sub> (TCRγδ<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>MHCII<sup>+</sup>) cells regarding surface markers (CD4<sup>+</sup> and C8<sup>+</sup>) and cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-12 and IL-17).  A total of 26.53% of γδ T<sub>DC</sub> - control group (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) - the proportion of αβ T<sub>DC</sub> was lower in splenic cells than γδ T<sub>DC</sub>; however, these 2 cell types were reduced in tumor conditions (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), and the proportion of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-12 and IL-17 cytokines produced by γδ T<sub>DC</sub> was higher than those produced by αβ T<sub>DC</sub>, but it decreased under conditions of tumor-related immune system response (<i>p</i> < 0.0001).  Healthy mice engrafted with malignant cells 4T1 breast tumor presented T<sub>DC</sub> with γδ TCR repertoire. These cells express cytotoxic molecules of lymphocytes T, producing anti-tumor proinflammatory cytokines.
34077989	To evaluate serum levels of adiponectin in pregnant adolescents between 30 and 36 weeks of gestation.  A prospective cross-sectional study enrolled 67 normal pregnant women between 30 and 36 weeks of gestation and eutrophic (body mass index [BMI]: 18.5-25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), of which 36 were adolescents (< 20 years old) and 31 adults (≥ 20 years old). Serum adiponectin levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The <i>t-</i>student or Mann-Whitney tests were used for intergroup comparison.  Pregnant adolescents showed significantly higher serum adiponectin concentrations compared with pregnant adults (<i>p</i> = 0.04). No differences were observed in adiponectin levels in younger pregnant adolescents (< 16 years old) compared with older pregnant adolescents (≥ 16 years old). Adiponectin values were divided into 3 subgroups: < 3,000 ng/mL, between 3,000 and 5,000 ng/mL, and > 5,000 ng/mL. Birthweight was significantly higher in women > 5,000 ng/mL when compared with < 3,000 ng/mL in the adolescent group. No association between pregestational adiponectin levels and BMI, gestational weight gain, and gestational age was observed; however, there was a positive relation with birthweight (<i>p</i> = 0.0239).  Serum adiponectin values in pregnant adolescents between 30 and 36 weeks of gestation were higher compared with pregnant adults; however, no differences between younger and older pregnant adolescents were observed.
34077990	In a healthy athlete, the caloric intake is sufficient for sports energy needs and body physiological functions, allowing a balance between energy availability, bone metabolism, and menstrual cycle. On the other hand, an imbalance caused by low energy availability due to a restrictive diet, eating disorders or long periods of energy expenditure leads to multisystemic deregulation favoring the essential functions of the body. This phenomenon, described as the female athlete triad, occurs in a considerable percentage of high-performance athletes, with harmful consequences for their future. The present review was carried out based on a critical analysis of the most recent publications available and aims to provide a global perception of the topic relative energy deficit in sport (RED-S). The objective is to promote the acquisition of more consolidated knowledge on an undervalued theme, enabling the acquisition of preventive strategies, early diagnosis and/or appropriate treatment.
34077991	Placental pathophysiology in SARS-CoV-2 infection can help researchers understand more about the infection and its impact on the maternal/neonatal outcomes. This brief review provides an overview about some aspects of the placental pathology in SARS-CoV-2 infection. In total, 11 papers were included. The current literature suggests that there are no specific histopathological characteristics in the placenta related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but placentas from infected women are more likely to show findings of maternal and/or fetal malperfusion. The most common findings in placentas from infected women were fibrin deposition and intense recruitment of inflammatory infiltrates. The transplacental transmission of this virus is unlikely to occur, probably due to low expression of the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in placental cell types. Further studies are needed to improve our knowledge about the interaction between the virus and the mother-fetus dyad and the impact on maternal and neonatal/fetal outcomes.
